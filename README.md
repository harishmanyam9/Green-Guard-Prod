## Green-Guard

## Overview
This repository contains a robust set of data pre-processing and visualization steps to prepare and understand a dataset of plant images, A notable dataset features 87,000 RGB images across 38 distinct classes. The primary objective of this research endeavor is to design a classifier proficient in discerning a plant's health condition based on an image. Examples of classes include "Strawberry - Healthy", "Tomato - Late Blight", "Apple - Cedar Apple Rust", and "Soybean - Healthy‚Äù.
